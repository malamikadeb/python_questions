Write a Python program that finds the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of three positive integers. The GCD is the largest number that divides all three numbers evenly. Use the property: GCD(a, b, c) = GCD(GCD(a, b), c)



def find_gcd(a, b, c):
    # Code Starts

    x = a
    y = b
    z = c
    while y != 0:
        temp = y
        y = x % y
        x = temp

    while z != 0:
        temp = z
        z = x % z
        x = temp

    return x

    # Code Ends

# Predefined inputs
a = 12
b = 18
c = 24

# Function call
print(find_gcd(a, b, c))

Write a Python program that counts the number of vowels and consonants in a given string. The function should return a tuple containing (vowel_count, consonant_count). Only alphabetic characters should be counted.



def count_vowels_and_consonants(text):
    # Code Starts

    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    vowel_count = 0
    consonant_count = 0
    for char in text:
        if char.isalpha():
            if char in vowels:
                vowel_count += 1
            else:
                consonant_count += 1
    return (vowel_count, consonant_count)


    # Code Ends

# Predefined inputs
str= "hello world"

# Function call
print(count_vowels_and_consonants(str))

Write a Python program that counts how many words in a given sentence are palindromes. The function should split the sentence by spaces and check each word individually, ignoring case sensitivity.



def count_palindrome_words(str1):
    # Code Starts

    s = str1.split()
    count = 0
    for item in s:
        if item == item[::-1]:
            count +=1
    return count
    # Code Ends

# Predefined inputs
str = "mom and dad are here"

# Function call
print(count_palindrome_words(str))

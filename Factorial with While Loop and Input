Write a Python program that asks the user for a number and prints its factorial using a while loop.



def main():
    num = int(input())
    if num < 0:
        print("error")
    else:
        factorial = 1
        while num > 1:
            factorial *= num
            num -= 1
        print(f"Factorial of {num} is: {factorial}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

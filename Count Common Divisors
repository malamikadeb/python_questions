Write a Python program that counts the number of common divisors of two positive integers. A common divisor is a number that divides both given numbers evenly.



def count_common_divisors(x, y):
    # Code Starts

    # Write your code here 
    x = a
    y = b

    # Euclidean algorithm to find GCD
    while y != 0:
        temp = y
        y = x % y
        x = temp

    gcd = x  # Store the final GCD
    count = 0

    # Count divisors of gcd
    for i in range(1, gcd + 1):
        if gcd % i == 0:
            count += 1

    return count
    # Code Ends

# Predefined inputs
a = 12
b = 18

# Function call
print(count_common_divisors(a, b))

Write a Python program that calculates the factorial of a number using loops. The program should show the calculation process step by step and display the final result.



def calculate_factorial(num):
    factorial = 1
    print(f"Calculating factorial of {num}:")
    print(f"{num}! = ")
    while num > 0:
        factorial = factorial * num
        if num > 1:
            print(f"{num} x ", end = " ")
        else:
            print(f"{num} = ", end = " ")
        num -= 1
    print(factorial)


# Predefined inputs
num = 5

# Function call
calculate_factorial(num)

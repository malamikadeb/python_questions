Using the numbers a = 10 and b = 15, write a Python program to find and print their LCM using a while loop.



def main():
    a = 10
    b = 15
    lcm = max(a, b)
    while True:
        if lcm % a == 0 and lcm % b == 0:
            print("LCM is:", lcm)
            break
        lcm += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

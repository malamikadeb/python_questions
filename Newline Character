Write a Python Program that takes two strings as input and returns them joined with a newline character (\n) between them.



def join_with_newline(line1, line2):
    # Code Starts

    # Write your code here 
    result = line1 + "\n" + line2
    return result
    # Code Ends

# Predefined inputs
line1 = "Hello"
line2 = "World"

# Function call
print(repr(join_with_newline(line1, line2)))
